# AGENT-LOG.md — what the recurring agent did, and did not do

Every run appends one entry here, **newest first**, including runs that changed
nothing. See `AGENT.md` for the brief.

Keep entries short and concrete. What was looked at, what was concluded, what
changed, what was deliberately left alone. If a measured number moved, put the
measurement in the entry — not the conclusion, the numbers.

## 2026-08-19 16:09 UTC — run 4: a repaired link said the door could not be built, when only the handle had moved

**Looked at:** the new draggable handle — the newest and least-worn surface —
at 390 and 1280, dragged with a real pointer on both, plus the `gp=` parameter
as untrusted wire input. Pulled 3 commits from the human first (565c966,
b258b6b, f760fab) and re-read the section they added to `AGENT.md`.

**Instruments:** test ✓ (2,031,429) · audit ✓ (5 viewports, drag checks
included) · profile ✓ · collide ✓ (2,052 base / 2,146 `all` / `boxes` ✓,
MOUNT_REACH 121) · recreate ✓ · shot ✓ (12 clean). Build stamps `index.html`,
which is why it is in the diff.

**Changed:** `settle()` now passes `repair`'s own sentences through as `said`,
and `showNotice` prints them instead of one generic line. Two files, plus an
assertion.

**How it was found.** The drag itself is sound — I tried to break it and could
not. `gp` is well defended: `99999,99999`, `-1,-1`, `1e308`, `NaN`, `abc`,
wrong arity, empty — every one clamps to a legal position or goes home, with no
negative geometry and no NaN reaching the markup. The caveat "מיקום הידית
להמחשה — נקבע בהתקנה" survives arriving by link, which is the case that
matters, because that is the page *Peretz* opens.

What was wrong was the sentence next to it. A link whose handle position needs
correcting arrived reading:

> השילוב בקישור לא ניתן לייצור — התאמנו אותו לדלת הקרובה ביותר.
> ("the combination in the link cannot be manufactured — we adjusted it to the
> nearest door")

Nothing about the door had changed. Colour, window, glass, grille, grip,
lockset, detail, size, handing — all exactly as chosen. Only the handle had
moved, and the handle's position is deliberately not in the short code, not in
the WhatsApp message, and described on the stage as settled on site. So the one
person the site exists to save a question is handed a reason to ask one.

Measured on the default door, sweeping a 25 × 50 mm lattice of positions:

    positions probed                    1353
    legal, no repair at all                9
    ONLY the handle moved               1344   <- all told the door was changed
    the design itself was repaired         0

**The cause is a fix that was made once and not carried.** `repair` already
writes one exact sentence per change, and `SAID.gripMoved` — "הזזנו את הידית —
במקום שבחרתם היא כבר לא מתאימה" — is the right words, already written. The log
records making that change for the *toast*, because a customer dropping to one
panel was being told we had removed their metal strips. The link notice is the
second reader of the same repair and was still a lookup keyed on the KIND of
notice, which can only be right while a kind means one thing. `combination-fixed`
means many things; a stale `gp=` is by far the commonest.

`option-unknown` and `code-unknown` keep their own words and are not
overridden — they are the worse news, and `settle` already ruled they win.

**Assertion:** a repaired link must carry the sentences that explain it, and a
link that moved only the handle must say so — swept over the same lattice,
skipping any case where a design field also moved. Backing the fix out fails it
five times over. Checked the longer strip at 320 px: it wraps to two lines, no
clipping, no sideways scroll.

**Left alone deliberately:**
- **The drag preview leaving the leaf.** Drag the handle far enough and it
  floats on the wall beside the door, red. It looks odd, but red-under-the-
  finger-then-snap-back is the interaction the human specified two commits ago
  and it is legible. Taste, not fault.
- **The `·` between two sentences** wrapping to the far end of the second line
  in RTL. The page already uses ` · ` as its separator; changing it here only
  would be drift.
- The mobile sticky CTA, the transom/motif backlog, and the three that need
  Peretz (finish, the three off-chart colours, prices).

## 2026-08-19 10:54 UTC — run 3: two suspicions measured away; one real fault found in an instrument

**Looked at:** the real page in Chromium at 390 and 1280, all four sections and
their categories opened; the order message; the short code; the recreations.
Pulled 7 commits from the human first (six drawing passes, ending at ce23e30).
Container came up with no `node_modules` — `npm install` first, and that is
worth knowing for future runs.

**Instruments:** run twice — once on arrival, then again after rebasing onto
the human's mid-run push, which is the run that gates this commit:
test ✓ (955,542) · audit ✓ (5 viewports, clean) · profile ✓ ·
collide ✓ (706 base / 754 `all` / `boxes` ✓, MOUNT_REACH 121 covered) ·
recreate ✓ · shot ✓ (12 states clean). Build reproduces the committed bundle
byte-for-byte. (On arrival, pre-rebase, it was 984,578 and 754 / 802 — the
counts moved because the 70 mm band refuses 204 more combinations.)

**Changed:** `MOULD_BAND` and `REBATE` are exported from renderer.js, and
`tools/recreate.mjs` now derives our moulding width instead of keeping its own
copy. No pixel of the site moves: the regenerated screenshots are
byte-identical and the bundle is unchanged. See "the fault" below.

Two other things looked wrong and neither survived being measured — recording
both so they are not re-investigated a third time:

1. **The two white swatches** (לבן RAL 9016D, לבן שבור RAL 9302D) read at a
   glance as empty boxes. Measured: fills rgb(241,240,234) and rgb(236,235,231)
   against a warm-white ground, but `.swatch__chip` carries a real
   `1px rgb(0 0 0 / .22)` border, and at 3× the rectangle is plainly there.
   White paint on warm-white paper looking like white paint is correct.

2. **The ten pull-handle tiles** all read as "a thin vertical line", which is
   failure #5/#6's shape and would be its third occurrence. The existing
   assertion compares tile *markup*, and CLAUDE.md §5 item 8 is explicit that
   an assertion has to name the object, not the document — so I rasterised
   every tile in every group and compared bitmaps instead. First pass said the
   handles were the tightest group in the interface (3.4–4.5% of pixels). That
   metric is wrong: these are line drawings on an empty ground, so a glyph
   painting 3% of its tile cannot differ from another by more than ~6% however
   different it looks. Renormalised against the union of the two marks — the
   ink, which is what a customer compares — the order reverses completely:

       handle    closest pair  שירן / להב שטוח   58.7%   (then 59.9, 75.3, 79.0)
       lockset   closest pair  רותם / ריבועי     37.1%
       window    closest pair  צוהר אנכי / חלון גבוה  37.4%
       colour    closest pair  לבן שבור / לבן    28.5%
       grille    closest pair  סורג ישר / סורג ישר בהיר  9.2%  ← tightest overall

   The handles are among the most distinct groups on the page, not the least.
   The 9.2% grille pair is `bars` vs `bars-light`: same pattern, same ₪220, the
   bars painted the door's colour instead of dark. Looked at it at 3× — the
   light variants draw in white and are unmistakable. Correct as drawn.

**The fault — a fifth tool holding our own number.** Mid-run the human pushed
`0aa5f84`, moving `MOULD_BAND` from 40 mm to 70. I rebased onto it and re-ran
all six. Everything was green, but `npm run recreate` still printed, of d048:

> its moulding is the corpus's HEAVY stock at 0.084 of leaf width where we now
> draw **the slim one at 0.043** — see MOULD_BAND

0.043 was typed into `tools/recreate.mjs` when the band was 40 mm. The standard
leaf is 950 − 2×50 = 850 mm, so at 70 mm ours is now **0.082** — against the
photograph's 0.084, and inside the corpus's heavy stock (0.069–0.098). The gap
the tool was reporting had been closed by the commit I had just pulled, and the
tool went on reporting it. That is exactly `glass.mjs` (CLAUDE.md §5 item 9),
which held our own pane numbers and reported a rebuilt pane as unchanged, and
it is the fifth tool here to hold a constant about our own drawing that quietly
stopped being true (§7).

Fixed by making the tool ask rather than remember: `MOULD_BAND` and `REBATE`
are now exported and `recreate.mjs` computes `MOULD_BAND / (w − 2·REBATE)`. The
photograph's 0.084 stays a literal — a measured record cannot go stale; only
our side of the comparison could. Note now reads "…at 0.084 of leaf width and
ours is 0.082".

Worth saying plainly: I had flagged the 40 mm band as looking too slim beside
d048 and deliberately did NOT touch it, because it was a taste decision the
owner's son had just made and re-measuring is allowed where overruling by eye
is not. The human moved it himself an hour later. Leaving it alone was right;
what was mine to fix was the instrument lying about it.

**Left alone deliberately:**
- **The pixel-comparison harness above.** It closes a documented assertion gap
  and it found nothing, so it would ship a fresh threshold chosen from a single
  snapshot — the exact species of constant that has silently gone stale in four
  tools already (CLAUDE.md §7). Left as a finding with its numbers so a second
  data point can decide it, rather than committed on one.
- The mobile sticky CTA, the transom/arched-panel/motif backlog, and the three
  items that need Peretz (finish, the three off-chart colours, prices).

## 2026-08-19 07:41 UTC — run 2 (plumbing only): push path verified from this session

**Looked at:** nothing in the site. This run exists only to prove the write
path that run 1 lost its work to.
**Instruments:** none run — the tree was clean and untouched at HEAD.
**Changed:** this entry, and nothing else. The push path was verified from
this session.
**Left alone deliberately:** everything. Everything was green and pushed
minutes before this run, and a change made to have made one is the thing
`AGENT.md` warns against.
**Commit:** see the commit carrying this entry.

## 2026-08-19 — run 1 (smoke test): found a real bug, could not push

**Looked at:** the closed accordion at phone and desktop widths.
**Instruments:** all six green.
**Found:** the static section sub-caption (`.sect__sub`, e.g. "חלון, סוג
זכוכית, סורג") was truncating to "…", unlike the line beside it which is
*meant* to truncate because it changes with the selection. Correct catch.
**Changed:** nothing reached origin. **The push was refused 403** — the
trigger-fired session had read access to the repo but not write, and the
environment came up with no clone at all. The commit died with the container.

**Fixed afterwards from the interactive session**, which does hold push
credentials — see the commit that follows this entry. The finding was
reproduced properly first (clipped by 6px at 1280 and 1680, 17px at 320),
then fixed further than the original: letting the caption wrap alone left
"סורג" orphaned on a second line and made one row taller than the other three.
The real fault was underneath it — `.sect__now` was `flex: 1 1 auto` and
`.sect__text` was `flex: 0 1 auto`, so the line that is DESIGNED to be cut
short was claiming space from the line that is not.

**Plumbing:** the Routine now fires into a session that has the repository
attached with push credentials, instead of a fresh one that does not. A
trigger-spawned session inherits the ENVIRONMENT's sources, and this
environment has none; `session_context.sources` is per-session.

**Commit:** none from the run itself.

## 2026-08-18 — set up, no run yet

The Routine was created in this session: every five hours, a fresh session in
the "door project" environment, pushing straight to
`claude/door-builder-website-plan-rgg7gu` — which is what GitHub Pages serves.

State handed over, so the first agent does not have to rediscover it:

- Everything is green: 930,968 assertions, audit clean at five viewports,
  profile clean, all three collide sweeps clean.
- The last changes were driven from outside, by the owner looking at the live
  site: the pane was simplified back to a gradient, the add-ons and the handle
  finish were withdrawn, the choices panel was folded into four sections, the
  panel inset was re-measured off the photographs, `bloom` was found to be
  over-bright on dark paint, the moulding was found to be drawing a raised
  panel that does not exist, and the pull-bar-versus-lever refusal was
  withdrawn in favour of moving the bar.
- **Open and recorded, not built** (ROUND5.md, end): a curved bow pull (d078),
  an arched raised panel (d071), a transom (d083 d109 d121 d129), cross and
  staggered strip patterns, and glass motifs we have no vocabulary for —
  interlocking circles (d106), a vine (d111), a branch (d114), a full
  classical composition (d080).
- **Open and needs a human**, so do not decide it yourself: six of the ten
  recreated doors carry brass or black hardware and the finish choice has been
  withdrawn (ASK-PERETZ.md §2b); three colours in the gallery are not on the
  Rav Bariach chart (§3); and every price is a placeholder (§5).
